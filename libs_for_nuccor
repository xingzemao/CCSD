Gcc-9.3.0 is the compiler used to compile nuccor
Install:
  method 1) sudo apt-get install gcc, but a follow up needed to check whether version 9.3.0 is installed (gcc --version)
  method 2) build from source file:
      pro: can specify installed path and easy for version control
      con: compile takes super long time
      a through introduction for installation can be found here:
      https://gist.github.com/yosoufe/ad45f45c10fe08abecbf53000d0d199f

There are three files needed to be installed to use nuccor: openblas, openmpi,hdf5
all libs are built from source here
1) openmpi:
   download from https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v4.0/
   gunzip -c openmpi-4.0.4.tar.gz | tar xf -
   cd openmpi-4.0.4
   ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/openmpi/$path.  (path is set as "4.0.4/gcc-9.3.0/" for this case)   
   make all install
2) openblas:
   download from https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/releases
   we chose openblas-0.3.10
   gunzip -c openblas-0.3.10.tar.gz | tar xf -
   cd openblas-0.3.10
   make 
   make install PREFIX=/usr/local/path
3) hdf5:
   download from https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/
   the latest version hdf5-1.12.0 is used
   gunzip -c hdf5-1.12.0.tar.gz | tar xf -
   cd hdf5-1.12.0
   ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/hdf5/$path  --enable-fortran , (path=/1.12.0/gcc-9.3.0/ in this case)
   make 
   make install
   (there is also instruction about installation at <http://micro.stanford.edu/wiki/Install_HDF5>)
   
   
The last step is set up environment module for better version control of the loaded libs
   The source file can be found here: <http://modules.sourceforge.net>
   Here (<https://modules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>) is a good reference for installation
   Installation:
   ./configure
   make 
   make install
